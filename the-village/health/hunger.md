## Hunger

Food has different components that have an impact on hunger, stamina, happiness, etc.  For instance candy (high sugar) may have a temporary boost but not a long term impact on hunger.  Hunger is a numbered range between 0 and 100, with 100 being the heighest.  A person doesn't need to be at 100 though.  In fact 100 is over full.  (Think a nice Thanksgiving dinner.)  A level of around 80 is actually the best.  Anything below 40 is really hungry and at 0 the person is pretty much dead.

* 100 - 85: Overfull
* 84 - 70: Full
* 69 - 55: Semi-full
* 54 - 40: Hungry
* 39 - 20: Very Hungry
* 0 - 20: Starving

Food Examples:

* Cooked chicken - hunger: 10 / stamina: 10 / hungerSaturation: 10 / happiness: 5
* Candy - hunger: 2 / stamina: 2 / hungerSaturation: 1 / happiness: 8
* Corn - hunger: 5 / stamina: 4 / hungerSaturation: 4 / happiness: 4
